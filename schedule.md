## 12: Transcriptomics and the analysis of RNA-Seq data

**Topics:**  
Analysis of RNA-Seq data with R. Differential expression tests. RNA-Seq statistics. Counts and FPKMs. Normalizing for sequencing depth. DESeq2 analysis. Gene finding and functional annotation from high throughput sequencing data. Functional databases KEGG, InterPro, GO ontologies, and functional enrichment.  


**Goals:**  
- Given an RNA-Seq dataset, find the set of significantly differentially expressed genes and their annotations.  
- Gain competency with data import, processing and analysis with DESeq2 and other Bioconductor packages.  
- Understand the structure of count data and metadata required for running analysis.  
- Be able to extract, explore, visualize and export results.  
- Perform a GO analysis to identify the pathways relevant to a set of genes (e.g. identified by transcriptomic study or a proteomic experiment). Use both Bioconductor packages and online tools to interpret gene lists and annotate potential gene functions.
